"""Make every rendered page pass the Nu HTML Checker (vnu).

Python-Markdown emits XHTML-style void elements and the Material theme ships a few
attributes that the HTML Standard does not allow. None of it is visible to a reader,
but it fails ``vnu``, which CI runs over the whole built site. Template overrides
would have to be re-synced on every theme release, so the output is corrected here
instead, on each page after the theme has rendered it:

* ``<hr />``, ``<br />``, ``<input ... />`` and the other void elements lose the
  trailing slash. SVG and MathML elements are left alone; there it is meaningful.
* ``tabindex=""`` on navigation labels is dropped (an empty string is not an integer).
* ``autocomplete`` is dropped from the theme's checkbox toggles, where it is not an
  allowed attribute.
* ``for="__toc"`` is dropped from the table-of-contents label on pages that render no
  table of contents, where the control it points at does not exist.

Two more corrections are for pa11y at WCAG 2 AAA (technique H32, "forms have a submit
button"), which CI also runs over every page:

* The colour-scheme switch is a ``<form>`` that is never submitted: its radio inputs
  act the moment they change. It becomes a ``<div>``; the theme's script finds the
  inputs through ``data-md-component="palette"``, not through the form.
* The search box filters as you type and has no submit step either, but it must stay a
  ``<form>`` because its "Clear" control is a reset button. It gains a ``hidden``
  submit button, which changes nothing for any user: the theme already handles Enter
  itself.

Every rule is a no-op on markup that is already valid, so this is safe to keep after
the theme fixes any of them upstream.
